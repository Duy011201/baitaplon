              <em>JavaScript</em> was initially created to “make web pages
              alive”.
            </p>
            <p>
              The programs in this language are called <em>scripts</em>. They
              can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as
              the page loads.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need
              special preparation or compilation to run.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language
              called
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)"

                  When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name:
                  “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it
                  was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger
                  brother” of Java would help.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent
                  language with its own specification called
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript"
                    >ECMAScript</a
                  >, and now it has no relation to Java at all.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on
              the server, or actually on any device that has a special program
              called
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine"
                >the JavaScript engine</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript
              virtual machine”.
            </p>
            <p>Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)"
                  >V8</a
                >
                – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey"
                  >SpiderMonkey</a
                >
                – in Firefox.
              </li>
              <li>
                …There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE,
                “JavaScriptCore”, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The terms above are good to remember because they are used in
              developer articles on the internet. We’ll use them too. For
              instance, if “a feature X is supported by V8”, then it probably
              works in Chrome, Opera and Edge.

                    The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the

                  <li>

                  <li>And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.</li>

                <p>
                  The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process.
                  It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the
                  data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine
                  code based on that knowledge.

              Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not
              provide low-level access to memory or the CPU, because it was
              initially created for browsers which do not require it.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s
              running in. For instance,
              <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">Node.js</a>
              supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary
              files, perform network requests, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage
              manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.
            </p>
            <p>For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify
                styles.
              </li>
              <li>
                React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements,
                key presses.
              </li>
              <li>
                Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and
                upload files (so-called

              JavaScript’s abilities in the browser are limited to protect the
              user’s safety. The aim is to prevent an evil webpage from
              accessing private information or harming the user’s data.
            </p>
            <p>Examples of such restrictions include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on
                  the hard disk, copy them or execute programs. It has no direct
                  access to OS functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Modern browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is
                  limited and only provided if the user does certain actions,
                  like “dropping” a file into a browser window or selecting it
                  via an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are ways to interact with the camera/microphone and
                  other devices, but they require a user’s explicit permission.
                  So a JavaScript-enabled page may not sneakily enable a
                  web-camera, observe the surroundings and send the information
                  to the
                  <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency"
                    >NSA</a
                  >.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other.
                  Sometimes they do, for example when one window uses JavaScript
                  to open the other one. But even in this case, JavaScript from
                  one page may not access the other page if they come from
                  different sites (from a different domain, protocol or port).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is called the “Same Origin Policy”. To work around that,
                  <em>both pages</em> must agree for data exchange and must
                  contain special JavaScript code that handles it. We’ll cover
                  that in the tutorial.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This limitation is, again, for the user’s safety. A page from
                  <code>http://anysite.com</code> which a user has opened must
                  not be able to access another browser tab with the URL
                  <code>http://gmail.com</code>, for example, and steal
                  information from there.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server
                  where the current page came from. But its ability to receive
                  data from other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it
                  requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from
                  the remote side. Once again, that’s a safety limitation.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Such limitations do not exist if JavaScript is used outside of the
              browser, for example on a server. Modern browsers also allow
              plugins/extensions which may ask for extended permissions.

                  <li>
                    Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these
              three things.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s what makes JavaScript unique. That’s why it’s the most
              widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              That said, JavaScript can be used to create servers, mobile
              applications, etc.

              The syntax of JavaScript does not suit everyone’s needs. Different
              people want different features.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s to be expected, because projects and requirements are
              different for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, recently a plethora of new languages appeared, which are
              <em>transpiled</em> (converted) to JavaScript before they run in
              the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modern tools make the transpilation very fast and transparent,
              actually allowing developers to code in another language and
              auto-converting it “under the hood”.
            </p>
            <p>Examples of such languages:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> is
                “syntactic sugar” for JavaScript. It introduces shorter syntax,
                allowing us to write clearer and more precise code. Usually,
                Ruby devs like it.

                concentrated on adding “strict data typing” to simplify the
                development and support of complex systems. It is developed by
                Microsoft.

                <a href="https://flow.org/">Flow</a> also adds data typing, but

                language that has its own engine that runs in non-browser

                JavaScript. Developed by Google.

              There are more. Of course, even if we use one of these transpiled
              languages, we should also know JavaScript to really understand
              what we’re doing.
